# Spotify_ETL_Project
Building an ETL from Spotify API and a weekly summary email report


### Motivation
The goal of this project is to build a whole pipeline of extracting data from Spotify API transform and load to local database, and generate weekly report send to my email. Iâ€™m extracting historical data from my personal Spotify account. Then, I applied pandas to do transformation and cleaning, processing, and load into a PostgreSQL database (Local Machine). Moreover, I utilized SQL and python(SQLAlchemy) to query metric information and send to my email weekly by using Airflow to trigger a schedule

### Pipeline

## ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)
#### _Extracting_
I utilized Spotipy package to extract my personal data from Spotify through Web API endpoints. The Data I collected including JSON metadata about music, artist, albums, and tracks. 

#### _Transforming_
From extracting data through Python, I applied pandas to transform all the data and put it into data frame format. Then load in to PosgreSQL database
	List of Transformation
		- Transformed and put it in to DataFrame format
			-  Albums Data
			-  Tracks Data
			-  Artist Data
			-  Feature Data
		- Create Unique Identifier for each song played
		- Converted date-time format
		- Generate a bridge dataset including unique id and metric call Fact table
#### _Loading_
First, creating databases on my local machine using PostgreSQL. Five tables were created including Album, Song, Feature, Artist and Fact to ingest data from transformation. I used .to_sql which is a function In Pandas to transform DataFram into SQL statement and load to PosgreSQL

## Weekly Summary Report
The weekly report is incorporate metrics from Spotify Wrapped yearly round up. I utilized SQL to generate the report such as Top 5 song played, Top 5 artists. Moreover, the email was sent directly from python script.

#### _Airflow_
Apache-Airflow was applied to ETL and Email Weekly python script to schedule a weekly run.
